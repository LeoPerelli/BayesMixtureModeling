## Overview

Mixture Models typically find application in density estimation and clustering problems.
Conventional Bayesian posterior inference on cluster-specific parameters struggles when clusters are placed too close to each other.

As an alternative, Repulsive Mixture Models generate the components from a repulsive process that naturally favours separation of clusters.

We want to build a Repulsive Mixture Model by adding to the prior of the centers a penalization term proportional to the Wasserstein distance.

Our goals as we proceed with the project are:
* formalize a Repulsive model using the Wasserstein Distance 
* investigate other models:
   * with heavier tails like t-student, but where the Wasserstein Distance can still be expressed in closed form
   * skew-normal, since it’s not a location-scale distribution and so the Wasserstein Distance can’t be expressed in closed form
